Here is an example of how you could make an AI-powered app called ThreatMapper that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze network traffic and identify anomalies.

This code loads network traffic data from a CSV file, preprocesses it using a MinMaxScaler, defines an LSTM model architecture, trains the model on the data, and uses the trained model to analyze new network traffic and identify anomalies. 
If an anomaly is detected, it prints a message with the probability of the anomaly and suggests security measures to mitigate the threat.

Note: This is just a basic example and would need to be expanded and refined for a production-ready app. Additional features could include:

- Incorporating more sophisticated anomaly detection algorithms.
- Handling large volumes of network traffic data.
- Integrating with network monitoring tools and systems.
- Providing more granular threat intelligence and visualizations.
- Allowing users to customize alert thresholds and rules.
- Suggesting specific security measures based on the identified threat.
- Integrating with incident response and communication tools.

But this demonstrates the core functionality of an AI-powered network threat detection app.
